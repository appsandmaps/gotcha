Building a social approach to safetey in the community. The gotcha app allows people to contribute their own informal reports of crime, 
vandalism and other inciendents with a simple interface. This brings these events to the attention of community members, leaders, businesses as well as 
public officials and lets us work together to strengthen our neighborhoods.
